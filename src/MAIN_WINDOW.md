# MAIN_WINDOW (Widget)

**This documentation is for the functions of the Widget class (MainWindow) if ever needed to change in future**

- Main application window using Qt framework
- Coordinates between authentication and chat interfaces
- Manages application lifecycle and window transitions
- Handles initial application setup and UI management

## Constructor
- **Takes optional parent widget parameter**
- **Initializes Qt UI components using UI file**
- **Sets up main application window**
- **Coordinates initial application state**

## Destructor
- **Cleans up UI resources**
- **Releases allocated memory for UI components**
- **Ensures proper Qt widget cleanup**

Note: This class appears to be a basic Qt Widget template and may need expansion based on the actual implementation in the .cpp file. The current header shows minimal functionality, suggesting most application logic is handled in other specialized classes like AuthWindow and ChatWindow.
